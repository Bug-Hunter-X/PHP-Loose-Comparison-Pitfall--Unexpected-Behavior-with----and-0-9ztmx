This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  The comparison `$_GET['id'] == 0` will evaluate to true not only when `$_GET['id']` is the integer 0, but also when it's the string "0". This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities if you're expecting an integer ID.

```php
<?php
if ($_GET['id'] == 0) {
  // Handle the case where the ID is 0
  echo "ID is 0";
} else {
  // Handle other cases
  echo "ID is not 0";
}
?>
```
