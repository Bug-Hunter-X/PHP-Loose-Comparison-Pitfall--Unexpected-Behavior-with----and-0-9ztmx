The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`).  Strict comparison checks both the value and the type of the variables.  This prevents the issue where a string "0" is treated as equal to the integer 0.

```php
<?php
if ($_GET['id'] === 0) {
  // Handle the case where the ID is the integer 0
  echo "ID is 0";
} else {
  // Handle other cases
  echo "ID is not 0";
}
?>
```

By using `===`, you ensure that only the integer value 0 will trigger the `if` block, avoiding the potential pitfalls of loose comparison and improving code robustness and security.
